/**
 * Where this operator's money goes, edited by the operator.
 *
 * Structured exactly like `OperatorOnboardingForm`: `.adm-form` holds notices and the submit, and a
 * single `.adm-form__section` is the card. That section already carries a surface, a border and a
 * shadow, so wrapping it in an `.adm-card` — as this component first did — stacked three identical
 * surfaces inside each other and turned every radio option into a box within a box within a box.
 *
 * A confirmation step gates the save, and the label names the method being switched to rather than
 * asking "are you sure" — the mistake worth catching is picking the wrong rail, and a confirmation
 * that doesn't name the destination cannot catch it.

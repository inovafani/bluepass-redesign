               `backdrop-filter` re-samples whatever is painted behind the element every time the
               compositor invalidates that region. The Kai panel sits above the navbar (its veil is
               a full-viewport layer at z-index 150), so hovering a card button repaints through
               that stack and forces this pill to re-sample. Chrome resolves the sample wrongly at a
               large `border-radius`, and the worst-hit spot is the corner with nothing drawn over
               it — the bare right cap past the last link, which flashed black on every hover. The
               left cap never showed it because the white active indicator paints over it.
               Dropping the blur removes the sampling entirely, so there is nothing left to
               mis-sample. The fill alone still reads as a container against the hairline below.
               Note the avatar and burger keep their blur: they are small, fully covered by their
               own content, and were never reported — but they sit on the same mechanism, so if a
               dark flash ever shows up on them, this is the reason and this is the fix. */

               of bare pill after the last link — the white indicator caps the left end, so that

/**
 * The page's colour vocabulary, in one place.
 *
 * The payouts page is meant to be read in three seconds, which only works if a given tone always
 * means the same thing: red is broken, amber is waiting on someone, green is done, grey is inert.
 * Mapping every status through here rather than per-call-site is what keeps that promise — a
 * PENDING ledger row and a FAILURE cron must not both be able to render as "some colour".

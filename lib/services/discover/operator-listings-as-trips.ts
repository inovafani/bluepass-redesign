 * no fabricated rating, reviews, testimonial quote, day-by-day itinerary, or operator-specific claims
 * - those fields are simply omitted (see the optional fields on Trip) rather than invented, and
 * TripGrid/TripSheet already hide the corresponding UI blocks when they're absent.
 *
 * Listings with no real price are skipped entirely rather than shown with a fabricated or zero
 * price - Trip.price is load-bearing for the "A$X/guest" display and the 5%-of-fare math in
 * TripSheet, both un-guarded in the UI, so showing one without a real number would look broken.

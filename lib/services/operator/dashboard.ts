 *
 * - `kai-tenant`  — the operator has a Kai Tenant of their own (`kaiTenantSlug`), so their ledger is
 *                   one tenant-scoped call. Most live `OperatorProfile` rows are this kind.
 * - `rezdy-agent` — a Rezdy-Agent operator discovered by the Discover sync. Kai's AU ledger
 *                   endpoints are tenant-scoped and this operator has no tenant of its own, so
 *                   there is no per-operator lookup to make. Their bookings exist; we cannot read
 *                   them from here yet.
 * - `unlinked`    — manually onboarded, not yet attached to any live booking source.
 *
 * The last two are not empty states and must never render as an empty table. "No rows" and "we
 * cannot see your rows" are different sentences, and only one of them is true here.

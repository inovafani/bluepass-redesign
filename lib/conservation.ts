/**
 * Conservation page content.
 *
 * Note on tone: this page is deliberately forward-looking — "will be dated",
 * "as reporting comes online". Nothing here claims funds already moved, and no
 * totals are invented. Keep it that way; the whole argument is auditability.
 *
 * Photography is served from /public. The partner cards crop to 9:11, so the
 * subject needs to sit near the centre of the frame.

/**
 * Both actions below re-derive the operator themselves rather than trusting the page-load gate, for
 * the same reason every write in the admin console does: the layout's check finished before these
 * buttons existed on screen. A tab left open after the profile was detached still holds a fully
 * rendered form.
 *
 * The stronger reason here is that the identity *is* the authorisation. There is no profile id in
 * the submitted form — it is read from the signed-in session every time, so a tampered payload
 * cannot aim this at another operator's payout details. That is why neither action accepts one.

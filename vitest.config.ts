 * sitting in a top-level `tests/` folder, so `include` points at `lib/`.
 *
 * Without vitest installed, the colocated `*.test.ts` files fail `tsc --noEmit`
 * on a missing `vitest` module — hence this config exists rather than the tests
 * being deleted or excluded from type-checking.

     * DB-backed files that reliably tripped the pooler's session-mode ceiling:
     *
     *   FATAL: (EMAXCONNSESSION) max clients reached in session mode - max clients are limited to
     *   pool_size: 15
     *
     * which surfaced as PrismaClientInitializationError in whichever files happened to lose the
     * race, not in the file that caused it. It was intermittent at seven files (one unexplained
     * failure per several runs) and deterministic at eight. Serialising costs wall-clock time and
     * buys a suite whose failures mean something.
